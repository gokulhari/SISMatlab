  abstract = {Abstract The pressure is a somewhat mysterious quantity in incompressible flows. It is not a thermodynamic variable as there is no ‘equation of state’ for an incompressible fluid. It is in one sense a mathematical artefact—a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the velocity field to remain divergence-free; i.e., incompressible—yet its gradient is a relevant physical quantity: a force per unit volume. It propagates at infinite speed in order to keep the flow always and everywhere incompressible; i.e., it is always in equilibrium with a time-varying divergence-free velocity field. It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well-defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. Herein we show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary.},

  abstract = {Several flows of practical interest are of viscoelastic fluids and it is desirable to know if these flows are in a laminar or turbulent state. In this paper, the laminar-turbulent transition is studied in which the convection of TollmienâSchlichting waves is investigated for the incompressible two-dimensional flow between two parallel plates. The viscoelastic fluid adopted is modeled by the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Linear Stability Theory (LST) were used to verify the stability of the viscoelastic fluid flow to unsteady disturbances. In the DNS formulation, the governing equations are discretized by high-order compact finite difference schemes for the spatial derivatives, while time integrations are carried out by a fourth order RungeâKutta method. For the LST analysis, the OrrâSommerfeld equation is modified to include viscoelastic effects and solved by a shooting method. In order to evaluate the flow stability when submitted to unsteady disturbances and to find the neutral stability curves, a range of numerical simulations was performed with different dimensionless parameters for the viscoelastic fluid flow and the results were compared with the Newtonian fluid flow. The influence of the elastic forces and the amount of the polymer concentration in the fluid were investigated. A wide range of polymer concentration was studied. The results show that the variation of the critical Reynolds number may be monotonic for certain conditions. The DNS simulations were carried out, and the amplification rates obtained were compared with the LST results, with a very good agreement. The DNS results allow also the visualization of the disturbances variation in streamwise and wall-normal directions, showing the behavior of the velocity components, vorticity and the non-Newtonian extra-stress tensor components. The DNS results show a significant change in flow structure for certain combinations of the polymer concentration and elastic forces parameters.},

After being dominated by modal (eigenvalue) analysis for many decades, a different perspective has emerged that allows the quantitative description of short-term disturbance behavior. A general formulation based on the linear initial-value problem, thus circumventing the normal-mode approach, yields an efficient framework for stability calculations that is easily extendable to incorporate time-dependent flows, spatially varying configurations, stochastic influences, nonlinear effects, and flows in complex geometries. },

This phenomenon has traditionally been investigated by linearizing the equations of flow and testing for unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem, but the results of such investigations agree poorly in many cases with experiments. Nevertheless, linear effects play a central role in hydrodynamic instability. A reconciliation of these findings with the traditional analysis is presented based on the "pseudospectra" of the linearized problem, which imply that small perturbations to the smooth flow may be amplified by factors on the order of 105 by a linear mechanism even though all the eigenmodes decay monotonically. The methods suggested here apply also to other problems in the mathematical sciences that involve nonorthogonal eigenfunctions.},

  abstract = {Various numerical methods for the solution of linear stability equations for compressible boundary layers are compared. Both the global and local eigenvalue methods for temporal stability analysis are discussed. Global methods are used to compute all the eigenvalues of the discretized system. When a guess for the desired eigenvalue is available, local methods may be used both to purify the eigenvalue and compute the associated eigenfunctions. The extension to spatial stability analysis is also considered. The discretizations studied include: a second-order finite-difference method, a fourth-order accurate two-point compact difference scheme, and a Chebyshev spectral collocation method. Eigenvalue results are presented for Mach numbers up to 10. As the Mach number increases, the performance of the spectral method deteriorates due to the outward movement of the critical layer. To alleviate this problem, a multi-domain spectral collocation method is developed which exhibits better convergence. The overall performance of the fourth-order compact scheme is excellent. Our results also indicate that, in the limit of vanishing Mach number, there exist stable discrete modes in addition to the discrete modes of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation.},

  abstract = {The stability of fully developed pressure driven plane laminar flow of a Maxwell fluid has been studied using linear hydrodynamic stability theory. Elasticity is destabilizing in the inertial regime, but the flow is found to be stable to infinitesimal disturbances at low Reynolds numbers. This result contradicts previous calculations, which predicted a low Reynolds number flow instability at a critical recoverable shear of order unity. The previous calculations were carried out using less accurate numerical methods; the eigenvalue problem which must be solved is a delicate one, requiring sophisticated umerical techniques in order to avoid the calculation of spurious unstable modes. This work has direct bearing on the question of the mechanism of a low Reynolds number extrusion instability known as “melt fracture”. It is observed that the intensity of melt fracture increases with increasing die length for high density polyethylene, and it is therfore believed by some experimentalists that fully-developed die flow is unstable for this polymer above a critical recoverable shear. The analysis appears to be at variance with this interpretation of the experimental results.},

A shooting method with a stiff integrator, orthonormalization, and Newton-Raphson iterations on the eigenvalue are used to find the eigenvalues.

  abstract = { One-point turbulence models are important tools for engineering analysis. A good model should have a viscoelastic character, predicting turbulent stresses proportional to the mean strain rate for slow deformations and stresses determined by the amount of strain for rapid distortions. Our goal is to build a one-point turbulence model with this character, and this requires a one-point model for rapid distortions. Here it is shown that the turbulent stresses introduced by Osborne Reynolds do not, by themselves, provide an adequate tensorial base for one-point modelling of rapidly distorted turbulence because they do not carry critical information about the turbulence structure. The deficiency is shown to be most pronounced in flows subjected to strong mean rotation. Additional one-point tensors that do carry the missing information are introduced, and the complexities of a model that would have an adequate tensorial base are assessed. A new type of one-point structure-based turbulence model that overcomes the basic deficiency of Reynolds-stress transport models, but without the excessive complexity of multiple tensor variables, is then described. The ideas behind the rapid distortion version of this new model are presented, along with results for some special cases. },

Motivated by these experiments we extend the previous calculations to the case of visco-elastic Poiseuille flow, using the Oldroyd-B constitutive model. Our results confirm that the subcritical instability scenario is similar for both types of flow, and that the nonlinear transition occurs for Weissenberg numbers somewhat larger than one. We provide detailed results for the convergence of our expansion and for the spatial structure of the mode that drives the instability. This also gives insight into possible similarities with the mechanism of the transition to turbulence in Newtonian pipe flow.},

Flow rate-wall shear stress measurements were conducted in 0.553 and 0.660 cm. diameter pipes. Polyethylene oxide samples of two molecular weights were employed, dissolved in water-glycerine mixtures with viscosities ranging from 0.0261 to 0.160 poise. The flow rate-wall shear stress relationship for these solutions corresponded to Poiseuille's Law below a well-defined onset wall shear stress, at which the Reynolds number was less than the transition value for Newtonian fluids. As the flow rate was increased from the onset condition, however, the wall shear stress became progessively larger than that predicted by the Poiseuille relationship. The onset wall shear stress for the phenomenon increased linearly with solvent viscosity. Its relationship to polymer concentration was dependent on the solvent viscosity. An explanation for early turbulence is suggested on the basis of these results, and the relationship of the phenomenon to turbulent flow drag reduction is discussed.},

Systematic studies are presented of the dependence of eigenvalues, transient growth factors, and other quantities on the axial and azimuthal wave numbers and the Reynolds number R for R ranging from 102 to the idealized (physically unrealizable) value 107. Implications for transition to turbulence are considered in the light of recent theoretical results of S.J. Chapman.},
